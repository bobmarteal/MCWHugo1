      <description>Does this work? Marteal Cycleworks is founded on the belief that everyone deserves to experience joy, adventure, and wonder on a bike, and that every cyclist, whether an avid racer, an occasional tourer, or a total beginner deserves to be valued and respected as a person, a cyclist and a customer.
MCW was founded by Bob Marteal after years of avid cycling and shopping the available market looking for good customer service and a bicycle that felt right, but always winding up like so many others; frustrated and feeling there was no place for him in the market.</description>

      <description>Youâ€™ll find this post in your content/posts directory.
To add new posts, simply add a file in the content/posts directory that follows the convention name-of-post.ext and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.
Hugo also offers powerful support for code snippets:
package main import &amp;#34;fmt&amp;#34; func print_hi(name string) { fmt.Println(&amp;#34;Hi, &amp;#34;, name) } func main() { print_hi(&amp;#34;Tom&amp;#34;) } //=&amp;gt; prints &amp;#39;Hi, Tom&amp;#39; to STDOUT.</description>
