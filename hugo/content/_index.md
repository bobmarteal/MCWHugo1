Hello world! I'm `content/_index.md`

Marteal Cycleworks is founded on the belief that everyone deserves to experience joy, adventure, and wonder on a bike, and that every cyclist, whether an avid racer, an occasional tourer, or a total beginner deserves to be valued and respected as a person, a cyclist and a customer. 

MCW was founded by Bob Marteal after years of avid cycling and shopping the available market looking for good customer service and a bicycle that felt right, but always winding up like so many others; frustrated and feeling there was no place for him in the market. In 2014 after hours of research he purchased what he thought would be his forever-bike. Shortly after he began to feel it wasn’t quite right, and didn’t feel he had anywhere to turn. 

With a frame that was too long in some places and too short in others, Bob experienced knee injuries, wrist pain, back pain, and discomfort that increased as his riding increased. The poor fit made him feel less safe and secure, leading to hesitation in less stable conditions (gravel and wet pavement). He was not able to ride to his potential before experiencing pain, and frequently cut his rides short, scuttling plans for longer day rides. A poorly matched bicycle was keeping his cycling ambitions on a short leash. 

He did all the adjustments he could think of — raising, lowering, widening and narrowing the handlebars, trying longer and shorter stems, moving the seat up, down, forwards, and backwards, and talking with bike sellers and specialists for advice.  
As a bicycle commuter and weekend warrior, while bicycle riding was not Bob’s life, it was an important part of it. And would have the potential to be even more important if he could just find the right bike.

After years of cycling on ill-fitting bikes, Bob encountered the world of the bespoke bicycle. He came to devour everything he could get his hands, eyes and ears on. One day while tapping a hole on his bicycle, he simply realized he would learn to make bicycles. He enrolled in the seven day framebuilder course at The Bicycle Academy and set forth a rather simple mission:

Build custom bicycles - so everyday people - could have - and ride - the bicycle of their dreams and experience joy and wonder while exploring the world where ever they may go.
