Hello world! I'm `content/_index.md`

Marteal Cycleworks is founded on the belief that everyone deserves to experience joy, adventure, and wonder on a bike, and that every cyclist, whether an avid racer, an occasional tourer, or a total beginner deserves to be valued and respected as a person, a cyclist and a customer. 

MCW was founded by Bob Marteal after years of avid cycling and shopping the available market looking for good customer service and a bicycle that felt right, but always winding up like so many others; frustrated and feeling there was no place for him in the market. In 2014 after hours of research he purchased what he thought would be his forever-bike. Shortly after he began to feel it wasn’t quite right, and didn’t feel he had anywhere to turn.
